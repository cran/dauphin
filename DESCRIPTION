Description: Phone numbers are often represented as strings because there
    is no obvious and suitable native representation for them.  This leads
    to high memory use and a lack of standard representation.  The package
    provides integer representation of Australian phone numbers with optional
    raw vector calling code. The package name is an extension of 'au' and 'ph'.
